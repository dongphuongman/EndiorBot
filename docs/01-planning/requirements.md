### FR-010: Team Agent Routing (Sprint 74)

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Tier |
|----|-------------|----------|------|
| FR-010.1 | Route team mentions (@planning, @dev, @qa, etc.) to leader agent | P0 | STANDARD+ |
| FR-010.2 | Inject team context (charter, teammates, delegation rules) into leader's SOUL | P0 | STANDARD+ |
| FR-010.3 | Agent-first namespace resolution: @pm always routes directly, not via team | P0 | ALL |
| FR-010.4 | Tier-dependent team availability (LITE: @fullstack only) | P0 | ALL |
| FR-010.5 | Team charter loading from TEAM-{id}.md templates | P1 | STANDARD+ |
| FR-010.6 | Shell @mention dispatch for interactive team routing | P1 | ALL |
| FR-010.7 | TeamRegistry with load, lookup, resolve operations | P0 | ALL |

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `@planning "design auth"` → routes to PM with team context (STANDARD+)
- `@pm "task"` → routes to PM directly without team context (all tiers)
- `@planning "task"` on LITE tier → error: team not available
- `@fullstack "task"` on LITE tier → routes to fullstack agent
- Shell `@dev "implement X"` → displays routing result with team info

### FR-011: Gateway Operational Resilience (Sprint 143-144) ✅ COMPLETE

**Trigger:** CEO real-world testing exposed 7 production issues in a single 2-hour Telegram session. Architecture review: [`docs/02-design/14-Technical-Specs/gateway-architecture-review-sprint-143.md`](../02-design/14-Technical-Specs/gateway-architecture-review-sprint-143.md)

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Sprint |
|----|-------------|----------|--------|
| FR-011.1 | Singleton serve enforcement (PID lockfile) — prevent duplicate processes | P0 | 144 ✅ |
| FR-011.2 | Provider health circuit breaker — skip dead providers immediately after 2 failures | P0 | 144 ✅ |
| FR-011.3 | Per-agent session lock — prevent duplicate concurrent calls for same agent | P0 | 143 ✅ |
| FR-011.4 | CC timeout → automatic fallback to Kimi/cloud (not error) | P0 | 143 ✅ |
| FR-011.5 | OTT channel timeout 60s (not 180s) with immediate Kimi fallback | P1 | 144 ✅ |
| FR-011.6 | Telegram message delivery guarantee (retry as plain text on parse failure) | P1 | 143 ✅ |
| FR-011.7 | Kimi model name resolution (non-Kimi model → default kimi-k2.6) | P1 | 143 ✅ |
| FR-011.8 | Deprecate Kimi subprocess spawner, document external proxy pattern | P1 | 144 ✅ |

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Cannot start 2 serve processes simultaneously (T1) ✅
- After 2 CC timeouts, 3rd @agent call skips CC → responds via Kimi in <30s (T2) ✅
- OTT @agent: total time-to-response ≤ 90s even when CC is down (T3) ✅
- CEO taps @coder 3x → only first processes, rest get "already processing" (FR-011.3 ✅)
- Telegram table-formatted response → plain text fallback, not silent loss (FR-011.6 ✅)

### NFR-004: Gateway Reliability (Sprint 143-144)

| ID | Requirement | Target | Priority |
|----|-------------|--------|----------|
| NFR-004.1 | OTT time-to-first-response | ≤ 90s (60s CC attempt + 30s fallback) | P0 |
| NFR-004.2 | Message delivery rate | 100% (retry plain text on Markdown failure) | P0 |
| NFR-004.3 | Provider failover time | ≤ 5s after circuit opens (skip immediately) | P0 |
| NFR-004.4 | Zero duplicate messages from serve process competition | P0 | ✅ Sprint 144 |
