# Sprint 139 — Requirements Specification

## Executive Summary

EndiorBot's evaluator loop (`src/evaluator/loop.ts`) runs a fixed-depth optimization cycle for every agent response — regardless of task complexity. Simple CEO questions (the majority) pay the same API cost and latency as critical architecture decisions. OpenMythos's Recurrent-Depth Transformer architecture demonstrates four patterns that translate to EndiorBot's agent domain: convergence-based halting, variable-depth iteration, frozen context anchoring, and iteration-aware prompting.

**Adoption plan:** [`.claude/plans/fuzzy-baking-pnueli.md`](../../.claude/plans/fuzzy-baking-pnueli.md)
**Sprint plan:** [`docs/04-build/sprints/sprint-139-plan.md`](../04-build/sprints/sprint-139-plan.md)

## Functional Requirements

### FR-139-1: Convergence-Based Early Stop (ACT analog)

**Source:** OpenMythos ACT halting (main.py:707-737)

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR-139-1.1 | Evaluator loop detects monotonic score decline over 2+ consecutive iterations and halts, returning best-scored response | P0 | Test: mock declining scores → loop exits after 2 declines, NOT after `maxRetries` |
| FR-139-1.2 | Flat score after a decline counts as non-convergence (uses `<=` comparison per CTO) | P0 | Test: score sequence [70, 65, 65] → halts at iteration 3; [70, 65, 66] → does NOT halt (uptick resets counter) |
| FR-139-1.3 | Convergence halt event emits a telemetry counter (`convergence_halts`) | P0 | Test: counter increments when guard triggers; does NOT increment on normal PASS or maxRetries exhaustion |
| FR-139-1.4 | Convergence signal feeds into `FailureClassifier` to prevent autonomous session over-fixing (CPO: anti-churn) | P0 | Test: after convergence halt, recovery engine does not retry the same task |

**Rollback criterion:** if convergence guard triggers on >40% of evaluator runs, the threshold is too aggressive → revert.

### FR-139-2: Dynamic Iteration Budget (Variable-depth analog)

**Source:** OpenMythos variable loop count (`max_loop_iters: 1-64`)

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR-139-2.1 | Evaluator `processResponse()` accepts optional `complexity?: TaskComplexity` and overrides `maxRetries` + `passThreshold` per complexity class | P0 | Test: `simple` → 0 iterations (skip eval); `critical` → 5 max iterations |
| FR-139-2.2 | Complexity-to-loop mapping: `simple=0/0`, `moderate=1/50`, `complex=3/65`, `critical=5/75` | P0 | Test: each complexity level produces the correct iteration count |
| FR-139-2.3 | Simple tasks bypass the evaluator entirely (zero API calls to evaluator model) | P0 | Test: simple-complexity request completes with 0 evaluator invocations |
| FR-139-2.4 | `TaskComplexity` signal flows from `context-injector.ts` through the call chain to evaluator | P0 | Integration test: inject complexity at ingress, verify it reaches `processResponse()` |
| FR-139-2.5 | Telemetry counter tracks iteration-budget-savings (how many iterations were saved vs. static `maxRetries`) | P0 | Test: counter emits savings = `staticMaxRetries - actualIterations` per request |

**Rollback criterion:** if simple-task latency doesn't improve (still >5s), the skip-eval path isn't wired correctly → investigate.

---

### FR-139-3: Frozen Input Injection (Context anchoring in eval loop)

**Source:** OpenMythos frozen input `e` re-injection (main.py:870-880)

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR-139-3.1 | `Optimizer.optimize()` accepts a `frozenContext: FrozenContext` parameter containing the original CEO task + SOUL identity | P1 | Test: mock optimizer → verify `frozenContext.originalTask` appears in every optimization prompt across 3 iterations |
| FR-139-3.2 | Frozen context is capped at 500 tokens (per CTO condition); truncated with `[...truncated]` marker if exceeded | P1 | Test: inject a 1000-token task → verify truncation to 500 tokens in the prompt |
| FR-139-3.3 | Frozen context is constructed once in `processResponse()` and reused across all iterations (not re-computed per iteration) | P1 | Test: `frozenContext` object identity is the same across iterations |
| FR-139-3.4 | Telemetry counter tracks frozen-context-token-usage per request | P1 | Test: counter emits token count of the frozen context |

**Rollback criterion:** if frozen context consistently pushes prompt above model's context window → reduce cap or remove.

---

### FR-139-4: Loop-Index Aware Optimization

**Source:** OpenMythos loop-index embedding (main.py:506-535)

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR-139-4.1 | `Optimizer.optimize()` accepts `iterationIndex: number` and `totalIterations: number` | P1 | Test: signature accepts the parameters; values are correct at each iteration |
| FR-139-4.2 | Optimization prompt text varies by iteration tier: early (1), middle (2), late (3+) | P1 | Test: extract prompt text at iterations 1, 2, 3 → all three are distinct |
| FR-139-4.3 | Strategy selection considers iteration number: early → low-risk (rephrase, add-context); late → aggressive (decompose, escalate-model) | P1 | Test: strategy `selectStrategy()` returns different priority ordering at iteration 1 vs 3 |

**Rollback criterion:** if later-iteration strategies produce worse results than early ones → remove iteration-aware prompting.

## Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Target | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-139-1 | Simple-task end-to-end latency (with eval skip) | <5 seconds | P0 |
| NFR-139-2 | Convergence guard hit rate (percentage of loops halted early) | >10% of evaluator runs | P0 |
| NFR-139-3 | Test suite regression | 0 regressions in 8K+ existing tests | P0 |
| NFR-139-4 | New test coverage | 20-30 new tests for all 4 adoptions | P0 |
| NFR-139-5 | Build health | `pnpm build` clean on every commit | P0 |
| NFR-139-6 | Frozen context token overhead | <500 tokens per request (CTO cap) | P1 |
| NFR-139-7 | TypeScript type safety | `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` compliance on all new interfaces | P1 |
