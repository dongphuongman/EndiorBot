# EndiorBot Product Vision

version: 3.0

sprint: 144

## Vision Statement

> EndiorBot is a **Solo Developer Power Tool** — an AI agent orchestrator that helps developers
> get answers in <30 seconds instead of 30-60 minutes, with full SDLC governance.

EndiorBot is NOT a platform, NOT an SDLC enforcer. It is a personal tool that runs locally on
the developer's machine, orchestrating 14 AI agents across 5 channels with enterprise-grade
discipline but solo-developer simplicity.

### Operational spine

For **stage alignment (00→09)**, **design-build-test traceability**, and the split between
**atomic** CLI/OTT/Web commands and **seamless workflows**, see
[`stage-command-workflow-spine.md`](./stage-command-workflow-spine.md).
Full stage index: [`docs/README.md`](../README.md).

## Autonomy Levels — What's Implemented (Sprint 144)

| Level | Name | Status | How It Works |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| **L1** | Assisted | **SHIPPED** | CEO invokes @agent, reviews output, decides next step |
| **L2** | Supervised | **SHIPPED** | Context anchoring, checkpoints, session persistence, per-chat workspace |
| **L3** | Semi-Autonomous | **SHIPPED** | `ENDIORBOT_AUTO_HANDOFF=true` + exec-policy presets. PM→Architect→Coder→Reviewer→Tester chain. CEO approves at gate boundaries only |
| **L4** | Autonomous | **PARTIAL** | AutonomousSessionManager exists (Sprint 72). Gate A/B/C scaffolded. Full 120min+ unattended sessions not yet production-tested |
