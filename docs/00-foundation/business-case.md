# Business Case

**Project:** EndiorBot
**Version:** 2.0.0
**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Author:** CEO/Solo Developer
**SDLC Stage:** 00-FOUNDATION
**Identity:** Solo Developer Power Tool (LOCKED)

---

## Executive Summary

> **EndiorBot is a Solo Developer Power Tool**
> Not a platform. Not an SDLC enforcer. Not an enterprise product.

EndiorBot eliminates copy/paste between AI apps by querying multiple models and consolidating responses automatically. Developers get answers in <30s instead of 30-60 min.

**MVP Investment:** 2-3 weeks (Tier 1)
**ROI:** 98% time savings on architecture decisions

## Value Proposition

### What EndiorBot Automates

| Manual Today | Automated with EndiorBot |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| Track which SDLC stage each feature is in | Auto-detect stage from file changes |
| Check if ready for gate (G0→G4) | Auto-evaluate gate criteria |
| Write CRP/MRP/VCR documents | Auto-generate from git commits |
| Calculate Vibecoding Index | Auto-calculate before commit |
| Switch context between projects | `endiorbot switch bflow` |
| Remember SDLC rules | Built-in SDLC 6.3.1 knowledge |
| Apply security checks | Auto-scan on file save |
| Query multiple AI models | Auto-orchestrate in parallel |
| Consolidate expert opinions | Auto-merge with consensus detection |

### What Developers Still Do (Cannot Automate)

| Developer Decision | Why Human Needed |
|--------------|------------------|
| Gate approval (G3, G4) | Business impact assessment |
| Architecture decisions | Creative/strategic thinking |
| Priority conflicts | Business value judgment |
| Breaking changes approval | Risk assessment |
| New feature scope | Product vision |

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Three Tiers (Per Master Plan v2.0)

| Tier | Timeline | Features |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Tier 1 — MVP** | 2-3 weeks | CLI, 2 models, read-only SDLC, Telegram notify |
| **Tier 2 — Pro** | 4-6 weeks after MVP | Auto-ADR, gate evidence, history compaction |
| **Tier 3 — Productization** | After 2-4 weeks usage | Desktop shell, Skills gateway, Junior hub |

**MVP Scope:**
```bash
endiorbot consult "<question>"  # 2 models, primary_with_notes
endiorbot gate status G2        # Read-only checklist
endiorbot switch <project>      # Minimal context
```

### Time Savings (ROI) - Per Master Plan v2.0

| Task | Before | After | Savings |
|------|--------|-------|---------|
| Architecture decision | 30-60 min | <30s | **98%** |
| Gate evaluation | 20 min | 1 min | **95%** |
| Context switch | 5 min | <2s | **99%** |

### Break-Even Analysis

Assuming 5 architecture decisions + 10 gate evaluations + 20 context switches per week:

| Activity | Time Saved/Week |
|----------|-----------------|
| Architecture (5 × 25 min) | 125 min |
| Gates (10 × 19 min) | 190 min |
| Switches (20 × 4.8 min) | 96 min |
| **Total** | **~7 hours/week** |

**Break-even:** 4 weeks development / 7 hours saved per week = **~23 weeks of use**

## Strategic Alignment

### With SDLC Framework v6.3.1

- Native SDLC compliance from day 1
- Auto-detect stages and gates
- Evidence collection for audits
- Vibecoding Index enforcement

### With Local Projects

| Project Scale | LOC | Tier | Integration |
|---------------|-----|------|-------------|
| Large (e.g. main product) | ~1M | ENTERPRISE | Full SDLC + Gate automation |
| Medium (e.g. service/bot) | ~200K | STANDARD | SDLC + Quick context switch |
| Xlarge (e.g. platform) | ~500K | ENTERPRISE | Full SDLC + Gate automation |

---

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Migration complexity | Medium | High | Incremental migration, build verification |
| TypeScript port issues | Medium | Medium | Behavioral test suite |
| Multi-model API costs | Low | Medium | Configurable model selection |
| Scope creep | Medium | High | Strict phase boundaries |

---

## Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|-------------|------|------|----------|
| Keep current workflow | No development | Inefficient, manual | ❌ Reject |
| Use existing tools (Cursor, etc.) | Ready to use | No SDLC, no multi-model | ❌ Reject |
| Build from scratch | Clean design | Long development | ❌ Reject |
| Fork OpenClaw + Enhance | Proven base, extensible | Migration effort | ✅ **Selected** |

---

## Recommendation

**Proceed with EndiorBot development** based on:

1. **High ROI** - 90%+ time savings on key activities
2. **Strategic fit** - Aligns with SDLC Framework and enterprise projects
3. **Manageable risk** - Incremental migration reduces risk
4. **Solo developer focus** - Purpose-built for the actual use case
